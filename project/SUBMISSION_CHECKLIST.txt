## 🔧 Pre-Submission Actions

### REQUIRED: Generate test_results.csv
```bash
cd /Users/HIESCHA/Projects/Private/udacity/udacity_agentic_ai_course_4/project
.venv/bin/python project_starter.py
```

This will:
1. Initialize database
2. Process all 20 test requests
3. Generate test_results.csv
4. Display financial report

### OPTIONAL: Review and enhance reflection.txt
After script execution:
1. Open test_results.csv
2. Analyze actual results
3. Update reflection.txt with specific metrics:
   - Exact number of cash balance changes
   - Number of fulfilled vs unfulfilled requests
   - Specific examples of system behavior
   - Any unexpected results
